      <p>Together with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the
        Africa CDC has developed a Pathogen Genomics Initiative to enable the roll out of next generation sequencing
        (NGS) for pathogen surveillance and response. Several nodes are being established across Africa under this
        initiative which will need to receive training on all aspects of NGS implementation.</p>
