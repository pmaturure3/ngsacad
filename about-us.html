        The <b>NGS Academy </b> for the Africa CDC's Africa Pathogen Genomics Initiative is coordinated
        by the University of Cape Town's Computational Biology Division (CBIO) in collaboration with Africa CDC and
        ACEGID. The NGS Academy draws on the expertise of H3ABioNet, a pan African bioinformatics network, which runs an
        extensive training and outreach program and which is led by CBIO.

      <p>Together with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the
        Africa CDC has developed a Pathogen Genomics Initiative to enable the roll out of next generation sequencing
        (NGS) for pathogen surveillance and response. Several nodes are being established across Africa under this
        initiative which will need to receive training on all aspects of NGS implementation.</p>
