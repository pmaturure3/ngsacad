The Division of Computational Biology (CBIO) at UCT provides bioinformatics support to researchers at the University of Cape Town. Two dedicated bioinformaticians were recently appointed: Dr Katie Lennard as lead bioinformatician for the Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine (IDM) and Dr Jon Ambler as lead bioinformatician for the Clinical Infectious Diseases Research Initiative (CIDRI). Although requests from the IDM and CIDRI therefore take priority, we welcome requests from other researchers and follow a collaborative model. That being said, we do not receive funding from UCT outside of IDM and CIDRI to provide support and we therefore encourage researchers to budget for bioinformatics services in their proposals.
